# ScholarTime Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: May 24, 2024**

## Introduction
This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy“) governs the data collection practices of **Connor Fischetti** (“**ScholarTime**”, “us”, “we” and “our”) when you use our **ScholarTime** browser extension (the “Extension”) or visit our website, **https://connortif1463.github.io/ScholarTime-Info/** (the “Website”). Within this Privacy Policy, the Extension and Website are referred to as our “Services”.

This Privacy Policy contains important disclosures on how we collect and use your information. Our foundational principle is that we are designed to **minimize data collection**. We do **not** collect, sell, or share your browsing history or the specific websites you visit. We encourage you to read this Privacy Policy carefully prior to using our Services.

## Information We Collect
Our primary design principle is user privacy. The ScholarTime extension is designed to collect the absolute minimum information necessary to function.

**Information You Provide Directly:**
*   You are not required to create an account. The extension functions entirely locally on your device.

**Information Collected Automatically:**
*   **Extension Settings:** Your custom blocklist, allowlist, and schedule preferences are stored **locally on your device** using your browser's local storage. This data never leaves your computer.
*   **Permission Justification:** The extension requires permission to access `<all_urls>` or web requests. This permission is used **in real-time, locally on your device,** solely to identify and block distracting websites based on your personal blocklist. **We do not log, transmit, or store the URLs you visit.**

**Information We DO NOT Collect:**
*   We do **not** collect, log, or transmit your browsing history, the specific URLs you visit, or page content.
*   We do **not** collect information about other applications on your device.
*   We do **not** use any third-party analytics or tracking code.
*   We do **not** sell, rent, or share any user data.

## How We Use Information
We use the minimal information we have solely for the following purposes:
*   **To Provide and Operate the Service:** To apply your blocklist settings locally on your device and restrict access to distracting websites in real-time.
*   **To Communicate with You:** To respond to your support requests or inquiries submitted via email or GitHub.
*   **For Open Source Development:** To discuss details related to code, feature suggestions, or bug reports submitted via pull requests or issues on the project's public repository.
*   **Legal Compliance:** To comply with applicable laws, regulations, or legal processes.

## How We Disclose Information
We do **not** sell, rent, or share your personal information.

Given the local-only operation of the ScholarTime extension, there is **no user data to disclose** to third parties in the normal course of service.

In the event we are legally compelled to do so, information may be disclosed:
*   **For Legal Compliance:** If required by law or in response to valid legal processes (e.g., a court order).

## Data Practices on Our Website
Our informational website (`https://connortif1463.github.io/ScholarTime-Info/`) is a static site built with React and hosted on GitHub Pages. It serves only to provide information about the ScholarTime extension.

*   **Cookies & Tracking:** The website does **not** use cookies, tracking pixels, analytics scripts (like Google Analytics), or any other tracking technologies.
*   **Embedded Content:** The website does **not** embed external content from social media platforms or other third parties that could set their own trackers.

**Third-Party Services in the Extension**
Our **ScholarTime browser extension** does **not** integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. All processing occurs locally on your device.

## Your Rights and Choices
Depending on your location, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information, such as the right to access, correct, or delete your data.

**Exercising Your Rights**
Given the local-only nature of the ScholarTime extension:
*   You can **view, modify, or delete your primary data** (your blocklist and settings) at any time directly within the extension's options page or by uninstalling it, which will remove all locally stored data.
*   For all other privacy inquiries or to formally exercise a legal right, please contact us at: **ctfischetti@gmail.com**.

We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe as required by applicable law.

## Use by Children
Our Services are not specifically directed to or intended for use by individuals under the age of 16. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with information, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child without parental consent, we will take steps to delete that information.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy will indicate when it was last revised. We encourage you to review this page periodically for any changes.
